## What does this do?
This project aims to replace or at least complement [`TCP Gecko.NET`](https://github.com/Chadderz121/tcp-gecko-dotnet) as platform independent Wii U RAM debugger and cheat code manager. It is developed in `Java` so you need to have [`Java`](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installed.

## Where do I post about problems I'm having?
Please post them [here](https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/JGeckoU/issues).

## How do I run this tool?
You need to download `JGecko U.jar` [here](JGecko%20U.jar?raw=true). Double-click it or type `java -jar "JGecko U.jar"` on the command line.

## What are the necessary steps to connect?
Download the [TCP Gecko Installer](https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/tcpgecko/blob/master/tcpgecko.elf?raw=true). Extract it to your SD Card into the folder `E:\wiiu\apps\TCPGecko`.
Proceed to run the [`Homebrew Launcher`](https://github.com/dimok789/homebrew_launcher) by visiting [this](http://wj44.ml/launcher/) URL with your Wii U. Finally, load the `TCP Gecko Installer` app and press A to install.

## Where can I discuss the development of this application?
I setup a [GBATemp topic](http://gbatemp.net/threads/development-of-new-wii-u-ram-debugger.413477/) dedicated to this.

## Where do I get help/support?
[This](https://gbatemp.net/threads/jgecko-u-setup-guide.426292/) is a good thread.
